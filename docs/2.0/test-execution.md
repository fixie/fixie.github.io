# Test Execution

One reason to override the [default convention](../default-convention) with a [custom convention](../custom-conventions) is to define the rules for **test execution**. In your `Convention` you will describe how (and how often) to construct your test classes, as well as what to do before and after each part of the [test class lifecycle](../test-lifecycle).

For instance, let's say we want all of our integration tests to be automatically wrapped in a database transaction.  Beside our tests, we place a custom convention class:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Fixie;

namespace IntegrationTests
{
    public class IntegrationTestConvention : Convention
    {
        public IntegrationTestConvention()
        {
            Classes
                .NameEndsWith("Tests");

            Methods
                .Where(method => method.IsVoid());

            FixtureExecution
                .Wrap<Transaction>();
        }

        class Transaction : FixtureBehavior
        {
            public void Execute(Fixture context, Action next)
            {
                using (new TransactionScope())
                    next();
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here, we're declaring that for each *Fixture* (in other words, each test class instance), wrap it in its own `TransactionScope` instance.  When the test class is constructed, you get a new `TransactionScope`.  After the tests are run for that instance, the `TransactionScope` is disposed.  You could alternatively wrap per-test-case (using the `CaseExecution` property) or per-test-class (using the `ClassExecution` property).

Contrasting with NUnit, `CaseExecution` wrapping corresponds with NUnit's `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]`, and 'FixtureExecution' wrapping corresponds with NUnit's `[FixtureSetUp]` and `[FixtureTearDown]`.
