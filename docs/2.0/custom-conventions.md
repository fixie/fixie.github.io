# Custom Conventions

Although useful for simple scenarios, the [default convention](../default-convention) may not meet your needs. Fortunately, you can replace it with your own.

If you don't want to go with the behaviors defined in the default convention, simply place a subclass of `Convention` beside your tests.  A custom subclass of `Convention` will reach out into the containing test assembly, looking for tests to execute.  Each convention can customize [test discovery](../test-discovery) and [test execution](../test-execution).  For test discovery, you describe what your test classes and test methods look like.  For test execution, you can take control over how frequently your test classes are constructed and how they are constructed.  Additionally, you can wrap custom behavior around each test case, around each test class instance, and around each test class.

Several sample conventions are available under the [Fixie.Samples](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/tree/{{page.codetag}}/src/Fixie.Samples) project:

* [Imitate NUnit](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/blob/{{page.codetag}}/src/Fixie.Samples/NUnitStyle/CustomConvention.cs)
* [Imitate xUnit](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/blob/{{page.codetag}}/src/Fixie.Samples/xUnitStyle/CustomConvention.cs)
* [Simplified NUnit for cleaner test inheritance](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/blob/{{page.codetag}}/src/Fixie.Samples/LowCeremony/CustomConvention.cs)
* [Construct integration test classes with your IoC container](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/blob/{{page.codetag}}/src/Fixie.Samples/IoC/CustomConvention.cs)
* [Support arbitrary command line flags such as NUnit-style categories](https://github.com/fixie/fixie/blob/{{page.codetag}}/src/Fixie.Samples/Categories/CustomConvention.cs)
